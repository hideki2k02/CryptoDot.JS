# CryptoDot.JS
# Cryptography made simple and free!

# What is CryptoDot and how was it made?
### CryptoDot was made to simplify your Encryption needs.

### The program was made with [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) and [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) with the help of the Software Framework [Electron.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework)).

## Previously it was made using [GODOT Engine](https://godotengine.org/) but it was too resource intensive for a simple app.
